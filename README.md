# Trackmon API Specification
This repository holds the API documentation for trackmon.
This is because of the inability to make releases in GitHub Wikis. In the future,
you can simply select a release to watch the API features at this point. Also, this
allows us to version server and clients independently, which means that the server
has its own release, which *conforms* to a API release, instead of *being* an API release.

Work in progress.
